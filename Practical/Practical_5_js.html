        jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event
        handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[4] As
        of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.[5] Web analysis indicates that it is
        the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having 3 to 4 times more usage than any other
        JavaScript library.[5][6]

        jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations,
        handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create
        plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level
        interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the
        jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
